CONCLUSION:
- Linear Regression performed best based on RMSE.
- Linear Regression outperformed traditional time series models, suggesting
  that including additional features beyond just historical prices provides
  valuable predictive information.

CLASSIFICATION RESULTS (Predicting Market Direction):
- Accuracy: 0.4545
- F1 Score: 0.0548
- The market direction prediction was challenging, suggesting more
  sophisticated approaches might be needed for classification tasks.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. For price level prediction, use the Linear Regression.
2. Consider ensemble approaches that combine multiple models to leverage
   the strengths of both machine learning and time series approaches.
3. For trend prediction (up/down), further feature engineering might improve results.

4. Future work recommendations:
   - Incorporate real news data for sentiment analysis
   - Explore ensemble approaches combining multiple models
   - Experiment with additional technical indicators
   - Investigate deep learning models like LSTM for time series prediction
   - Consider volatility modeling through GARCH models
